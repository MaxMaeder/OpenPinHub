# What You'll Need

- An Ai Pin
- Any interposer (learn how to buy or build one <Link href="../../interposers">here</Link>)
- A computer with Chrome

---

# Step 1: Connect Your Ai Pin

- Remove the moon sticker from the back of your Ai Pin
- Place Ai Pin in the interposer, connect the interposer to your computer
- Click 'connect' & select the "Ai Pin" USB device when presented with a popup

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

**Ai Pin doesn't show up in USB popup**
This typically indicates an improper connection between the Ai Pin and interposer. Ensure your Ai Pin has sufficient battery charge, then verify the positioning in the interposer. For optimal contact, gently adjust the Ai Pin's position within the interposer to align the connection points properly. It's _possible_ that your interposer, is malfunctioning.

**Ai Pin fails to connect**
Check for a popup on the laser ink display confirming you want to let your computer connect. If this appears, click accept.
If you are running Android Studio, shut down Android Studio and execute the command 'adb kill-server` as adb will block the connection from OpenPin Hub.
**Other issues**
Try reloading the page, or ask in the [reHumane discord](https://discord.gg/JtQzPHFeBc).
